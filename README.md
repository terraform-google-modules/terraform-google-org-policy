# Google Cloud Organization Policy Terraform Module

This Terraform module makes it easier to manage [organization policies](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/overview) for your Google Cloud environment, particularly when you want to have exclusion rules. This module will allow you to set a top-level org policy and then disable it on individual projects or folders easily.

## Compatibility
This module is meant for use with Terraform 0.13+ and tested using Terraform 1.0+. If you find incompatibilities using Terraform >=0.13, please open an issue.
 If you haven't
[upgraded](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-13.html) and need a Terraform
0.12.x-compatible version of this module, the last released version
intended for Terraform 0.12.x is [v4.0.0](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-google-modules/-org-policy/google/v4.0.0).

## Usage
Many examples are included in the [examples](./examples/) folder, but simple usage is as follows:

```hcl
module "org-policy" {
  source            = "terraform-google-modules/org-policy/google"
  version           = "~> 3.0.2"

  constraint        = "constraints/serviceuser.services"
  policy_type       = "list"
  organization_id   = "123456789"
  enforce           = true
  exclude_folders   = ["folders/folder-1-id", "folders/folder-2-id"]
  exclude_projects  = ["project3", "project4"]
}
```

### Variables
To control module's behavior, change variables' values regarding the following:

- `constraint`: set this variable with the [constraint value](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/org-policy-constraints#available_constraints) in the form `constraints/{constraint identifier}`. For example, `constraints/serviceuser.services`
- `policy_type`: Specify either `boolean` for boolean policies or `list` for list policies. (default `list`)
- Policy Root: set one of the following values to determine where the policy is applied:
  - `organization_id`
  - `project_id`
  - `folder_id`
- `exclude_folders`: a list of folder IDs to be excluded from this policy. These folders must be lower in the hierarchy than the policy root.
- `exclude_projects`: a list of project IDs to be excluded from this policy. They must be lower in the hierarchy than the policy root.
- Boolean policies (with `policy_type: "boolean"`) can set the following variables:
  - `enforce`: if `true` or `null` then the policy is enforced at the root; if `false` then policy is not enforced at the root. (default `null`)
- List policies (with `policy_type: "list"`) can set **one of** the following variables. Only one may be set.
  - `enforce`: if `true` or `null` then policy will deny all; if `false` then policy will allow all (default `null`)
  - `allow`: list of values to include in the policy with ALLOW behavior. Set `enforce` to `null` to use it.
  - `deny`: list of values to include in the policy with DENY behavior. Set `enforce` to `null` to use it.
- List policies with allow or deny values require the length to be set (a workaround for [this terraform issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/10857))
  - `allow_list_length`
  - `deny_list_length`
